		<h4>Mountains are prominent landforms that have significant heights above sea level and/or the surrounding land. 
		They are steeper than hills. A mountain or mountain range usually has a peak, which is a pointed top.
		Mountains have different climates than land at sea level and nearby flat land.</h4>

            <h2>A hill is a piece of land that rises higher than everything surrounding it. 
	    It looks like a little bump in the Earth. Since they are higher than everything around them, 
	    hills are good places to get a nice view. Hills are easier to climb than mountains.</h2>
